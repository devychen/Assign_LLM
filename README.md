# LLM Coursework Project Plan

# Experiencing Co-Creativity: The Practice and Evaluation of Writing Reality Show Scripts with GPT-4 by Professionals

**Objectives**

Academically, not many research works have been done on the implementation of LLM in reality show script writing although there is a long standing topic for applying LLM to generate film/TV/play scripts. This project aims to fill the gap. In addition, most of them only focus on story/plot generation itself, which is understandable as it’s more technology-related, but we will focus on the production process which includes pre-production (the generation of ideas, the casting, the choices on locations) and production (the script).
Practically, GPT4 has a huge improvement compared to previous versions and arguably has become an unprecedented tool. Its release might lead to a fundamental revolution in the creative industry. To have a systematic idea on how GPT4 could (or not) help the production, and also to shed some light on future development of TV show script writing systems, we’d like to see how GPT4 could help the professionals in the current workflow. More specifically:
To what extent and for what part is it helpful? (Both advantages and shortcomings: e.g. creativity, bias, plagiarism, etc.)
How do the professionals feel about the co-creativity process? (Ownerships, user experiences)
How is the quality of the final output?
